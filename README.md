# Hotel_EDA_and_Dash_Visualisation
A EDA of 500k hotel reviews, with the reviews being located Europe, while the reviewees are from worldwide. Visualised interactively in Dash as a exercise!


## Example of visualisation in the dashboard:

For this to work, you need to download this dataset: [515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/huypui/data-515k-rating-hotel/download?datasetVersionNumber=2) and insert it into the data folder. The dataset was unfortunately too large to upload to github (242mb).

To run the dash app, simply run the python file (make sure all the imported modules are installed) and head to http://127.0.0.1:8050

There is some visual EDA inside the notebook as well, however my primary focus was on the interactive Dash visualisation!
